In addition some authors influence other authors' interests. In this work, we propose to model the influence of cited authors along with the interests of citing authors. Moreover, we hypothesize that apart from the citations present in documents, the context surrounding the citation mention provides extra topical information about the cited authors. However, associating terms in the context to the cited authors remains an open problem. We propose novel document generation schemes that incorporate the context while simultaneously modeling the interests of citing authors and influence of the cited authors. Our experiments show significant improvements over baseline models for various evaluation criteria such as link prediction between document and cited author, and quantitatively explaining unseen text.","2011","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2014-11-11 12:03:44","2274–2280",,,,,,,"IJCAI'11",,,,"AAAI Press","Barcelona",,,,,,"ACM Digital Library",,"bibtex: kataria_context_2011",,,,"AuthorshipAttribution; TopicModeling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because no method is perfect, using a set of methods on the same works can be used to give high probabilities of authorship. The JGAAP system houses a collection of methods such as Histogram Distance and Manhattan Distance and event sets such as word bigrams and character trigrams to allow users to perform multiple tests on contested works to see if the supposed author is actually the author by comparing samples from both the contested author and other possible authors. We apply this framework and show a notable discontinuity in the authorial style of the novel El Ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha, better known as Don Quijote (or Don Quixote).","2010","2016-11-17 14:47:33","2017-01-21 11:56:12",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"London",,,,,,,,"bibtex: coufal_authorship_2010-1",,,,"AuthorshipAttribution; lang_esp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Digital Humanities Conference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
